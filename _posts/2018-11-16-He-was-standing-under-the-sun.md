He was standing under the sun. Started to stare at it. Perhaps for a long time. That’s the last thing he remembers. White lines appeared, all around him. Lifting him up, moving him to places. The places were neither ordinary, nor strange to him. He has been there before. For a few times. Those lines… There was something about them. Something mysterious. 

They suddenly dissolved into nothingness. Leaving him all alone. There was only a vast void. Once he finally started to become conscious again, an utter terror shook his entire body. In fact, he didn’t have a body, even tough he still had the sense of it. The sun disappeared. The planets? They were gone. Perhaps they have never existed in the first place. For how long he has been there? Years? Centuries? Did it even matter? There was no time. No motion. He tried to look all around him. But there was nothing.At least, nothing to make a sense of difference in his perspective. Everywhere looked the same, there was no directions. What about the life he had? His family, job, friends? There was no trace of them. All are erased. Except from his mind. He had all the memories about them, all those seemingly real sensations and shared emotions. Yet, he was all he had at that moment. I have to wait then, he thought, nothing else to do. But for how long? And for what? What can you wait for in a timeless, frozen place? One thing was clear, he had gone mad. 

Suddenly, he saw light. Those lines, yes, the same white lines again! But how, what was going on? The stream of light beams approached him, that was the only piece of motion he has experienced so far. He was excited, and terrified at the same time. The lines went through him. They grabbed him. Then, something extraordinary happened. He gained a perception of another dimension. Matter had width from now on. He looked around, it wasn’t like before. When he looked down, he saw infinitely many narrow rectangle glass segments under him. He saw himself inside those glasses, infinitely many versions of himself! They were trapped there, like snapshots in time. Then he started moving. When he was near those glass segments, the truth struck him. All the different versions of him experienced the same exact thing as he did. Those "people" inside those glasses in that huge glass field all were slices of his self in this infinite universe. Time was doing its job, it was now his turn to become the next moment of his “self”.

Almost immediately after he past by that giant field of glass segments, he lost his perception again. Universe was two-dimensional again. A powerful light stream hit him. He has never seen such a powerful light. It was everywhere, all around him. The light defined his reality. In fact, he was a part of the light. Then he was on Earth again. It was a sunny day, children were playing at the park. One of them kicked the ball too hard that the ball came near him, he took the ball and gave it to the kids. They smiled at him, he smiled back. What a lovely day, he thought. He had to finish that report that his boss asked for, but it could wait. Then again, he was standing under the sun. Started to stare at it…
